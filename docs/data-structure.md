## Cities and Roads

### City Nodes

The `City` nodes represent French cities. They were imported from a dataset of 627
French cities (source: [simplemaps.com](https://simplemaps.com/data/fr-cities)).
Each city contains properties such as name, administration, population, and its
geographical location (latitude/longitude stored as a Neo4j `Point`).

### ROAD_TO Relationships

Since no suitable road dataset was readily available, a road network was simulated
to enable routing between cities.

**Reasoning and Creation:**

1. **Initial Connectivity (KNN):** To create a realistic yet manageable set of roads,
   we used the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) approach. Each city was connected to its
   5 nearest neighbors using the `ROAD_TO` relationship. The distance in kilometers
   was calculated and stored on the relationship property `km`.
2. **Ensuring Full Connectivity (WCC):** After the KNN step, the graph contained
   several disconnected clusters. To ensure that an itinerary can be calculated
   between any two cities, we used the Weakly Connected Components (WCC) algorithm
   to identify these clusters.
3. **Manual Iteration:** We iteratively identified the nearest cities between
   different clusters and connected them with `ROAD_TO` relationships until the
   entire graph became a single connected component.

### Visual Representation

**Reproduce the visualization with:**

```cypher
match(c1:City {name: "Marseille"})-[r2:ROAD_TO]->(c2:City) limit 5
return c1, c2
```

## Points of Interest (POI) and Types

### POI Nodes

`POI` nodes represent various tourist attractions, hotels, restaurants, etc.,
imported from the [DataTourisme](https://www.datatourisme.fr/) API. They contain
metadata such as labels, descriptions, contact information, and coordinates.

### Type Nodes and IS_A Relationship

Instead of using Neo4j labels to categorize POIs (e.g., `:POI:Restaurant:Hotel`),
we use a separate `Type` node and an `IS_A` relationship.

**Reasoning:**

- **Multiple Categorization:** DataTourisme provides a wide and often overlapping
  set of types for each POI. Using nodes for types is more flexible than managing
  a large, dynamic set of labels on individual POI nodes.
- **Hierarchy Support:** Using nodes allows for future expansion into a hierarchical
  type system (e.g., a `"Bistro"` `IS_A` `"Restaurant"`).
- **Query Performance:** It simplifies queries that need to filter POIs by category,
  especially when dealing with many categories or complex overlaps.

**Reproduce the visualization with:**

```cypher
MATCH (c:City {name: "Lyon"})
MATCH (p:POI)-[:IS_IN]-(c)
LIMIT 5
MATCH (q:POI)-[:IS_NEARBY]-(c)
LIMIT 5
MATCH (p)-[:IS_A]->(t1:Type)
MATCH (q)-[:IS_A]->(t2:Type)
RETURN c, p, q, t1, t2
```

### CSV Schema

**CSV Schema of a POI is defined like this:**

## Spatial Relationships

### IS_IN

The `IS_IN` relationship connects a `POI` to a `City`.

- **Creation:** This relationship is created when the `city` property of a POI
  exactly matches the `name` of a `City` node.
- **Purpose:** It provides a direct link between a city and its attractions,
  facilitating quick lookups for POIs within a specific municipality.

### IS_NEARBY

The `IS_NEARBY` relationship is used for POIs that do not have a direct `IS_IN`
link to a city (often POIs located outside city limits).

- **Creation:** For POIs without an `IS_IN` relationship, the system searches for
  the nearest `City` node within a 100km radius. A link is created to the single
  closest city. The distance is stored in `distance_km`.
- **Purpose:** It ensures that every POI is associated with at least one urban
  center, which is crucial for itinerary planning and "nearby" search functionality.
