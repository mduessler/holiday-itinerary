## Commands

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust values if needed. In any case, you have
to set the env varible **AIRFLOW_CONN_NEO4J_API_CONN** to *http://neo4j-api-dev:8080*
in the `.env` file

1. **make run-dev** — Starts the development environment
2. **make down-dev** — Shutdown the development environment and deletes the
   docker container.
3. **make clean-dev** — Removes all docker container, images and volumes of
   the development
   environment.
4. **make tests** — Execute the tests of the project.

## Pre-commit

The project uses **pre-commit** to automatically enforce code formatting,
linting, and basic consistency checks before commits are created.

It applies to Python source code and Markdown files and helps catch common
issues early, keeping the codebase consistent across frontend and backend.

## Poetry

The project uses **Poetry** for dependency management and virtual environment
isolation.

Poetry ensures consistent dependency versions across frontend, backend, and
development tooling, and is also used by pre-commit hooks to run tools inside
the correct virtual environment.

## Tests

Tests can be executed using `make tests`, which runs the test commands defined
in the `tests/` target of the Makefile.

## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions are used to automatically validate the project on every push and
pull request to the `master` branch.

- **Lint**: Runs all `pre-commit` hooks using Python 3.13 to enforce formatting
  and code quality.
- **Test**: Executes the test suite in a Docker-enabled environment via
  `make tests`.

## Logging

The project uses a shared logging setup based on **Loguru**, which is imported by
both the frontend and backend.

The logger provides consistent formatting and log levels across all components
and also intercepts Python’s standard `logging` module so that third-party
libraries and internal code use the same output.

Logging behavior can be configured via environment variables:

- **LOG_LEVEL** – Sets the minimum log level (compatible with standard Python
  logging levels).
- **LOG_HI** – Enables or disables colored and formatted console output.

All application code should use the shared `logger` instance instead of defining
custom logging configurations.

## Manual Data Import

Dataset from datatourisme.fr can be downloaded here:

- [dataset](https://diffuseur.datatourisme.fr/webservice/b2ea75c3cd910637ff11634adec636ef/2644ca0a-e70f-44d5-90a5-3785f610c4b5)
- [latest dataset](https://diffuseur.datatourisme.fr/flux/24943/download/complete)

The .zip archive is around 1 GB large and unzipped around 8 GB.

The **make_dataset.py** script takes the directory and converts it into CSV files
that can be directly imported by Neo4j.

File `poi_nodes.csv` contains information about the POI except for the `types`
field.\
Types is a list of roughly 350 unique type descriptions. Therefore, the types
are mapped using the **Super-Node Pattern**, where for every type a node is
created and every POI node gets a relationship to it.

Files `type_nodes.csv` and `poi_is_a_type_rels.csv` contain the type nodes and
their relationships.

## Export and import dataset

The commands describe an option to create, export and import the dataset to
a neo4j database. A bulk data for testing purposes is located at
[tests/data/bulk/](../tests/data/bulk/).

1. Download and create nodes **POI**, **POITypes**, and **City** and the relationship
   **IS_A** with the command
   ```shell
   poetry run transform-datatourisme
   ```
2. Next you need to start the database to create the relationships **ROAD_TO**,
   **IS_IN**, and **IS_NEARBY** and the graph **city-road-graph** with the command
   ```shell
   docker compose up neo4j neo4j-post-init
   docker compose exec neo4j mkdir -p /tmp/export
   ```
3. To create the csv of each node and relationship, execute this commands from
   the neo4j ui
   ```cypher
   // --- Export POI Nodes ---
   CALL apoc.export.csv.query(
       "MATCH (n:POI) RETURN n",
       "/tmp/export/poi_nodes.csv",
       {}
   );

   // --- Export POIType Nodes ---
   CALL apoc.export.csv.query(
       "MATCH (n:POIType) RETURN n",
       "/tmp/export/type_nodes.csv",
       {}
   );

   // --- Export City Nodes ---
   CALL apoc.export.csv.query(
       "MATCH (n:City) RETURN n",
       "/tmp/export/cities_nodes.csv",
       {}
   );

   // --- Export IS_A Relationships ---
   CALL apoc.export.csv.query(
       "MATCH ()-[r:IS_A]->() RETURN r",
       "/tmp/export/poi_is_a_type_rels.csv",
       {}
   );

   // --- Export ROAD_TO Relationships ---
   CALL apoc.export.csv.query(
       "MATCH ()-[r:ROAD_TO]->() RETURN r",
       "/tmp/export/roads_rels.csv",
       {}
   );

   // --- Export IS_IN Relationships ---
   CALL apoc.export.csv.query(
       "MATCH ()-[r:IS_IN]->() RETURN r",
       "/tmp/export/poi_is_in_rels.csv",
       {}
   );

   // --- Export IS_NEARBY Relationships ---
   CALL apoc.export.csv.query(
        "MATCH ()-[r:IS_NEARBY]->() RETURN r",
        "/tmp/export/poi_is_nearby_rels.csv",
        {}
   )
   ```
4. Copy the files from the docker to the host and delete the directory on the
   container with the command
   ```shell
   docker cp $(docker compose ps -q neo4j):/tmp/export ./export-data
   docker compose exec neo4j rm -rf /tmp/export
   ```
5. Zip all csv files and delete them with
   ```shell
   for f in ./export-data/*.csv; do
      zip "./import-data/${f%.csv}.zip" "$f"
   done
   rm -rf ./export-data
   ```
6. Now u can import the data to a neo4j database with the command. Replace
   *\<VOLUME>* with the actual volume, and *\<CONTAINER>* with the actual
   container.
   ```shell
   docker run --rm \
       --volume=$PWD/import-data:/import \
       --volume=$(docker volume inspect -f '{{.Mountpoint}}' <VOLUME>):/data \
       <CONTAINER> \
       neo4j-admin database import full neo4j\
            --overwrite-destination \
            --verbose \
            --multiline-fields=true \
            --nodes="City=/import/cities_nodes.zip" \
            --nodes="POI=/import/poi_nodes.zip" \
            --nodes="POIType=/import/type_nodes.zip" \
            --relationships="ROAD_TO=/import/roads_rels.zip" \
            --relationships="IS_A=/import/poi_is_a_type_rels.zip"\
            --relationships="IS_IN=/import/poi_is_in_rels.zip" \
            --relationships="IS_NEARBY=/import/poi_is_nearby_rels.zip"
   ```
7. *(Optional)* — Copy the content to [tests/data/bulk](../tests/data/bulk)
   to use it as dataset for the development environment.
